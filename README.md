## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://github.com/Mason-Dino/MySphere/blob/main/Product-Shots/Home-Screen.png?raw=true)

MySphere is a locally hosted File System that is ran on Raspberry Pi 4B. With [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) it allows me to access this system all around the world! This has all access of a normal File System on the Web. 

Bonus Features: 

- Process: this allows the use of `pm2`  and I'm able to run any pm2 process within that feature
- Scripting: This page allows me to make shell scripts to help run programs to make sure they have the proper environment.
